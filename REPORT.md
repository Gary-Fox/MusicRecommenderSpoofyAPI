## Challenges:
**Challenge 1: /**
Problem: There was a method that required a track-type variable and was instead given a string. The method was trying to identify a track based off it's ID number.
Solution: Removed the call for ID number, since the object calling for it was already the track in question.
Learned: Sometimes a solution is as simple as deleting a small tidbit of code, and it's best to look for simple soluitions over convoluded ones (such as converting the string to a track, or trying to gather a track from the string.)

**Challenge 2: /**
Problem:

## Design Pattern Justifications
**Strategy Pattern: Strategies were modeled after lab documents provided to us by our instructor. Genre strategy is self explanitory, simply utalizing data gatherd from tracks and matching it as closely as possible to the searched/desired track. We also added a slight popularity modifier, just to add some priority over the potential 1,000 alternative pop rock songs. The hybrid strategy would have employed a random precentage weight of popularity, simularity, and genre, with popularity being the heaviest bias.** 
**Factory Pattern: I neither now what this is or how it may or may not exist within our program.** 
**Observer Pattern: I neither now what this is or how it may or may not exist within our program.**
